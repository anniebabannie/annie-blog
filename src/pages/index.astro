						<p>Gensho is a tool that helps users build foreign language flashcards quickly by looking up words as you highlight them. How it works: Copy and paste in any foreign text (anything you'd like to study from, like song lyrics, news articles, etc). Then simply highlight the words you don't know. You can then download that list of words and their definitions, and upload them to literally any flashcard program. Supported languages: Japanese, Spanish, French, German, and Italian.</p>
						<p>Designed, developed and marketed a SaaS product from the ground up, built in Ruby on Rails and ReactJS.</p>
						<p>Gensho was a passion project of mine that I eventually turned into a full-fledge SaaS product, and now boasts a healthy following of over 2000 users.</p>
